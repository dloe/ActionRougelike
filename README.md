Unreal Training - Course Reference
Course Found on: https://www.tomlooman.com/
Unreal Class focusing on professional game development in C++ and Unreal Engine. Aimed at learning and mastering C++ integration with blueprint systems and showcasing knowledge in a ActionRougeLike enviornment.

This project is meant as a workspace for projects, homework assignments, lessons and learning module coursework. Course taught formally at standford to teach students but now accessible for game devs.

Will be periodically coming back to this project to tweak assignments or experiment.
